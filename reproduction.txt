agents reproduce at a certain age IF they have enough energy
perhaps in a later iteration have this age/energy requirement depend on complexity

sexual reproduction (perhaps in a later iteration)


agents are born with the amount of energy required to reproduce
agents are born into a random position unrelated to their parent
mutation occurs accorgin to the mutation rates:
        "mutation rate" -chance of mutation happening
        "response permutation rate"
        "response insertion rate"
        "response deletion rate"
        "heuristics deletion rate"
        "heuristics insertion rate"
        "vision mutation rate"
        "memory mutation rate"
