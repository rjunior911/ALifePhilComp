Simplified versions:
important values:
    background energy   - from non-living sources
                        - can be absorbed
    life energy         -can be stolen/defended
    costs of absorption/defense/attack
    energy packet size  -the size of a chunk of energy which a given organism can absorb/steal/defend
                        -this will (in a later iteration) depend on an organism's complexity
    costs of existence/complexity   -which are taxes paid by living agents every timestep

at every timestep the following happens:
    every agent's knowledge is updated (see knowledge.txt)
    energy allocation:
        first we decide how much background energy each agent absorbs
            -those who invest more are more likely to get what they wanted
        then we decide how much life energy is reserved by those who defend themselves
        the remaining life energy goes into a pot which is then taken from
            -those who attack more are more likely to get the amount they wanted

    movement is calculated after all of the above, and it costs more to move for those with more energy
    then the world decides who is still living as described in death.txt
    of the living, those who are able to reproduce (see reproduction.txt) are considered
    the above repeats until the end of time (in the digital world)

More Detailed Description (for Joseph's eyes):
energy allocation:
	relevant physical constants:
		cost of being
		cost of absorption
		cost of attack
		cost of defense
	each organism has a set packet size determined by its cost of being, for simplicity these are equal
	the energy in a square consists of the available background energy and the cumulative life energy
	the overall cost of each action is the investment multiplied by the associated physical constant
	each action is only performed if the agent can afford it
		absorbtion:
			sort in decreasing order of packets attempted the agents and address each request in turn
				if a request cannot be met, it is skipped	
				otherwise, it is met by allocating background energy as requested
		defense:
			after absorption
			do not include the defended packets in the life energy during the attack phase
		attack:
			after absorption and defense
			take the amount of life energy TLE
			rank by aggressiveness, assign life energy to the most aggressive until there is no more
			THIS IS A CENTRAL PIECE OF THE MODEL AND MUST BE DEBATED AND REVISED AS SUCH
			
motion calculation:
	relevant physical constants:
		friction
	after energy allocation
	friction assigns a cost of motion based on the amount of energy one has (mass) this cost of motion is multiplied by the amount of spaces one attempts to move, if the agent cannot afford it, motion does not take place but not all energy is expended
		friction then determines a penalty for ineffective motion. for now, this is zero
		
	
	after absorbtion/attack/defense/motion assignment takes place, Death selects those who have not met their quota and marks them
		 costs of being are subtracted from each entity which remains alive
		cost of action is subtracted from each
		motion is enacted for living entities
