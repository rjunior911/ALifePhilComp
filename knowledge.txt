an organism's knowledge is a matrix with (memory) number of rows and (2*vision+1) columns
    there is a special column for the organism to know how much energy it has 
    the rest tell it how much its surrounding cells in either direction have
    the number in each entry is not the axact energy given by the world but the energy level
        -energy levels are distinguished from one another by separators, which an organism can evolve to have more or less of
    if an organism moves, unknown cells in its memory remain unknown

knowledge is upated by the agent.observe function at every timestep until an agent dies
